# 🎵 Pitch Fixer App 🎶

**Pitch Fixer App** is a tool that allows users to change the **pitch/key** of YouTube videos directly from the video link. The app converts the pitch of the video and allows users to download the adjusted video for later access. This way, you can easily and practically adjust the tone of any music or audio from videos. 🚀

I came up with the idea for this app because of my church, a simple neighborhood church where people sing but don't have musicians to accompany them. Some choose to sing with playback, but this makes you dependent on always having to sing in the same key as the original singer, who has a lot of vocal technique and range, which results in very high and unreachable notes for those who don't have such techniques.
